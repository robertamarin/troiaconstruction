              Angelos started in Limassol, Cyprus, where at his family company he built over 50
              timber-frame homes, becoming the first to bring this construction style to the island. He moved
              to the United States to build on his own path, where he met Robert Amarin, an
              experienced contractor in the mining industry. They began with smaller projects, grew
              each time, and founded TROIA Construction.
            </p>
            <p>
              From our home base on Prospect Street in La Jolla, we guide homeowners, developers,
              and architects across Greater San Diego with tailored project delivery. Robert and
              Angelos stay on site, on the phone, and accountable from the first consultation
              through turnover.

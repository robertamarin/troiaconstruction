          <h3>What areas do you serve?</h3>
          <p>
            We are headquartered at 243 Prospect St in La Jolla and serve clients
            across San Diego County—from coastal communities to inland suburban
            neighborhoods. We also take select projects in Orange and Riverside
            Counties.

          <h3>Are ADUs really a focus for Troia Construction?</h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. Accessory Dwelling Units are a core practice area. We
            guide homeowners through feasibility, permitting, and turnkey
            construction for detached, attached, and over-garage ADUs that meet
            California&apos;s evolving regulations.

          <h3>Can you handle just one part of my project?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. In addition to full-scale builds, we take on individual trades
            such as framing, foundation work, roofing, siding, and exterior
            envelope upgrades when builders or homeowners need a reliable
            specialist.

          <h3>Do you collaborate with outside architects and designers?</h3>
          <p>
            We regularly partner with architects, interior designers, and
            engineers. Bring your preferred design team or let us introduce one;
            either way we coordinate seamlessly to honor the creative vision and
            deliver on schedule.

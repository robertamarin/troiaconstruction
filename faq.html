              <h3>Where do you work?</h3>
              <p>
                Our headquarters is at 243 Prospect Street in La Jolla, California. We serve all of
                San Diego County, including La Jolla and Chula Vista, and continue north through
                Orange County.

              <h3>How long do ADU permits take in San Diego County?</h3>
              <p>
                Most jurisdictions now target 60-day reviews, but coastal overlays or design review
                boards can extend timelines. We shepherd submittals, respond to plan check comments,
                and keep you informed of every milestone.
              </p>
            </article>

            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3>How are ADU utilities and tie-ins handled?</h3>
              <p>
                We coordinate electrical load calculations, gas sizing, sewer tie-ins, and water
                pressure requirements. Our field teams execute trenching, conduit runs, and service
                upgrades so your ADU integrates cleanly with the primary residence.

            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3>Do ADUs require additional parking?</h3>
              <p>
                State law has relaxed parking mandates when your property is within a half-mile of
                public transit or includes a garage conversion. We verify local ordinances and, when
                required, plan compliant on-site spaces without compromising design.
              </p>
            </article>

            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3>What setbacks should I expect for an ADU?</h3>
              <p>
                Detached ADUs typically require four-foot side and rear setbacks, while attached
                units follow primary-structure standards. We confirm zoning overlays early so your
                design maximizes allowable building envelope.
              </p>
            </article>

            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3>How do coastal overlays impact ADU approvals?</h3>
              <p>
                Projects inside the California Coastal Zone can trigger extra reviews. We collaborate
                with planners, prepare supplemental coastal documentation, and manage hearings to keep
                your permit on track.

            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3>How long does an ADU build usually take?</h3>
              <p>
                Construction durations range from four to seven months depending on scope and site
                access. We build detailed schedules, maintain founder-led oversight, and communicate
                weekly progress updates.
              </p>
            </article>

            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3>Can you help me understand ADU financing options?</h3>
              <p>
                We guide clients through lender conversations, highlight construction-to-permanent
                loans, and share best practices for leveraging home equity while keeping carrying
                costs predictable.
              </p>

            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3>Do you only build ADUs?</h3>
              <p>
                ADUs are a core specialty, but we also deliver custom residences, multifamily
                improvements, and boutique commercial builds. We frequently partner with clients on
                targeted trade scopes such as framing, foundations, roofing, and siding.

            </article>

            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3>How hands-on are the founders?</h3>
              <p>
                Robert and Angelos attend weekly site walks, lead subcontractor coordination, and
                handle key client updates personally. They remain involved from preconstruction
                through turnover.
              </p>
            </article>

            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3>What is your founders’ pledge?</h3>
              <p>
                Founder accountability, weekly status updates with photos, transparent budget
                tracking, and rapid decisions on site. If you call, a founder answers.
              </p>

            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3>Do you work with outside design teams?</h3>
              <p>
                Absolutely. We collaborate with architects, interior designers, and engineers
                throughout California and can recommend partners suited to your project&apos;s scope and
                aesthetic.
